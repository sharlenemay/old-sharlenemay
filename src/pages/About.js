              <p>
                Hello! I'm Sharlene (also known as May) and I'm a Full Stack Web
                Developer with a background in the Social Sciences and
                Humanities and a budding passion for UX Research and Web Design.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have interest in all things both human and digital. When I'm
                not coding, I dedicate my time to researching and writing about
                emerging media, environmental sustainability, racial injustice,
                and everything in between. I'm also a slow fashion activist and
                tiny house enthusiast.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since graduating with my Bachelorâ€™s degree, I've worked in
                non-profit and corporate settings near and far; from my home
                city of Los Angeles to the suburbs of Tokyo and rural Japan.
                Having experienced life in different parts of the world, my goal
                is to bring people together through inclusive and inspiring
                digital platforms and the optimization of human-centered web
                applications across diverse cultural environments.
